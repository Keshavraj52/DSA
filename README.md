# DSA Practice & Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks for practicing and learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python. The code covers a variety of fundamental algorithms, problem-solving techniques, and coding patterns, making it a useful resource for interview preparation and academic study.

## Repository Structure

- **DSA.ipynb**: Step-by-step explanations and implementations of classic sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort) and other DSA concepts.
- **practice.ipynb**: Practice problems on array manipulation, such as finding smallest/largest elements, reversing arrays, and moving zeros to the end.
- **practices.ipynb**: Additional practice, including string reversal and other utility functions.
- **t-1patterns.ipynb**: Pattern printing problems (stars, numbers, pyramids, etc.).
- **t-2 linkedlist.ipynb**: (Reserved for linked list problems and solutions.)
- **TCSNQT.ipynb**: Coding problems inspired by TCS NQT and similar placement exams, including array, string, and bit manipulation challenges.

## Features

- Well-commented Python code for clarity and learning.
- Step-by-step breakdowns for complex algorithms.
- Real interview-style problems and solutions.
- Pattern printing and basic programming exercises.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Python extension.
3. Run the code cells and experiment with the examples.

## Topics Covered

- Sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort)
- Array and string manipulation
- Bit manipulation
- Pattern printing
- Recursion (Fibonacci, Factorial)
- Problem-solving for coding interviews
