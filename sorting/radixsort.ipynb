    "## 🔑 Key Idea of Radix Sort\n",
    "Radix sort works by sorting numbers digit by digit, starting from the **least significant digit (LSD)** to the **most significant digit (MSD)** (or vice versa, depending on the variant).  \n",
    "It uses a **stable sorting algorithm** (commonly counting sort) at each digit level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as organizing exam papers first by the **units place**, then by the **tens place**, then by the **hundreds place**, until everything is sorted.\n",
