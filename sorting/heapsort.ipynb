    "## 🔑 Key Idea of Heap Sort\n",
    "Heap sort uses a **binary heap** (usually a max-heap) to repeatedly extract the largest element and place it at the end of the array.  \n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Build a max-heap from the array.\n",
    "2. Swap the root (largest element) with the last element.\n",
    "3. Reduce heap size by 1 and heapify again.\n",
    "4. Repeat until the array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "Let’s sort `[4, 10, 3, 5, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Build Max-Heap\n",
    "- Original array: `[4, 10, 3, 5, 1]`\n",
    "- After heapify: `[10, 5, 3, 4, 1]` (10 is root, largest element)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Extract Max (10)\n",
    "- Swap root with last element → `[1, 5, 3, 4, 10]`\n",
    "- Heapify first 4 elements → `[5, 4, 3, 1, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Extract Max (5)\n",
    "- Swap root with last element in heap → `[1, 4, 3, 5, 10]`\n",
    "- Heapify first 3 elements → `[4, 1, 3, 5, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Extract Max (4)\n",
    "- Swap root with last element in heap → `[3, 1, 4, 5, 10]`\n",
    "- Heapify first 2 elements → `[3, 1, 4, 5, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Extract Max (3)\n",
    "- Swap root with last element in heap → `[1, 3, 4, 5, 10]`\n",
    "- Heapify first 1 element → `[1, 3, 4, 5, 10]`\n",
    "\n",

    "    left = 2 * i + 1\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Check if right child exists and is greater\n",
    "    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:\n",
    "        largest = right\n",
    "\n",
    "    # If largest is not root, swap and continue heapifying\n",
    "    if largest != i:\n",
    "        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]\n",
    "        heapify(arr, n, largest)\n",
    "\n",
    "def heap_sort(arr):\n",
    "    n = len(arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Build max heap\n",
    "    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):\n",
    "        heapify(arr, n, i)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Extract elements one by one\n",
    "    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n",
    "        arr[0], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[0]  # swap\n",
    "        heapify(arr, i, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return arr\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "data = [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]\n",
    "print(heap_sort(data))  # [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]\n",

    "## 📌 Characteristics\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**  \n",
    "  - Building heap: \\(O(n)\\)  \n",
    "  - Extracting max repeatedly: \\(O(n \\log n)\\)  \n",
    "  - Overall: \\(O(n \\log n)\\) worst, average, and best case.\n",
    "- **Not stable:** Equal elements may not preserve order.\n",
    "- **In-place:** Requires only constant extra space.\n",
